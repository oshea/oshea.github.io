# Reading Notes: Stripe Atlas guide to scaling engineering organizations

[Stripe Atlas: Guide to scaling engineering organizations](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/scaling-eng)

> We’ve deliberately chosen to add engineers at a slower rate than the growth of of our user base and instead take an iterative approach to recruiting and developing our team. We were able to keep teams small, invest more in each person, and nimbly change our ways of working as needs changed.

> we’ve built a culture of feedback and iterative thinking that enables us to continually make changes as we grow

## Hiring

I’ve found our processes run well for about 6-9 months before we need to update them.

Our questions seek to understand how people approach real world problems, rather than testing for esoteric skills you might demonstrate on a whiteboard. 

We standardize questions using written rubrics that define exactly how to run each interview, evaluate those questions consistently, and compare scores across candidates. A good rubric outlines the goals of the interview and provides clear criteria to evaluate the candidate’s performance.

Candidate Review is a recurring meeting with a set of experienced reviewers that’s used to examine all interview results.

Before the interview, we share written guides to help them understand Stripe’s culture and prepare for the interview. 

Tips and exercises

* Write rubrics for your most commonly asked interview questions and integrate them into your applicant tracking system.
* Write and share an interview prep guide with incoming candidates.
* Setup a quick survey to learn about the interview experience and ways to improve it.


## Onboarding

> it’s easy to turn mistakes into accidental company norms. Today, we invest significant time and energy in onboarding and helping all new hires grow their impact.

For all new employees, we developed Stripe 101: a general onboarding program that connects new hires across the company. In just a few weeks, people learn about Stripe by attending classes, meeting with our co-founders, building a Stripe integration, and answering support tickets. 

Today, we group new hires into temporary virtual teams for 3-4 weeks. Teams work with a dedicated mentor to learn about our development process while shipping a concrete tool or product improvement.

Stripe 101 includes a class called Communicating at Stripe that describes company mailing lists, best practices for email, and bug trackers, but also non-obvious communication patterns like how to schedule meetings. 

Engineering teams provide specialized guides for specific tools (e.g. GitHub or JIRA) or common practices like code review. These act as a source of truth and allow teams to collaboratively agree on their processes upfront, reducing ongoing debate or confusion. 

Tips and exercises:

* Pilot 1-2 onboarding classes that give an overview of your company and products.
* Write a culture or group-norm-oriented guide for your team, e.g. how to email, calendar, and complete code reviews.

## Engagement and retention
> Employee happiness often depends on two factors: whether they know the impact of their work and feel autonomy in the decisions they make every day. Beyond this, successful teams need to provide structure to keep team members engaged for the long-term. They need to actively listen to feedback, define clear paths for personal growth, and train leaders to best support their teams.

> a simple conversation about his career aspirations would have revealed his concern. People stay engaged when they feel a personal sense of growth, and you can support this by looking beyond day-to-day productivity and asking the right questions. 

At Stripe, we create internal resources to advertise new teams, encourage employees to rotate onto new projects, and run hackathons to foster creativity.

* Identify the problem
* Design a way to collect structured feedback
* Address the feedback, deliver the results

Developer Experience survey to guide their work, including questions such as:

* In the last week, how many hours did you lose due to problems with your development process?
* With our tools or infrastructure, what are 1-2 things we could do to make you more productive?
* In the codebase you work in, what’s harder than it should be?
