[re:Work](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)

the goal was to answer the question: “What makes a team effective at Google?”

researchers had to determine how to quantitatively measure effectiveness…decided to use a combination of qualitative assessments and quantitative measures

*The researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.* In order of importance:
* Psychological safety: no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.
* Dependability: members reliably complete quality work on time and meet a high bar with their work
* Structure and clarity: team has clear roles, plans and goals 
* Meaning: work is personally important to team members
* Impact: team members think their work matters and creates change

The researchers also discovered which variables were NOT significantly connected with team effectiveness at Google:
* Colocation of teammates (sitting together in the same office)
* Consensus-driven decision making
* Extroversion of team members
* Individual performance of team members
* Workload size
* Seniority
* Team size
* Tenure

Of the five key dynamics of effective teams that the researchers identified, psychological safety was by far the most important. 

To measure a team’s level of psychological safety, Edmondson asked team members how strongly they agreed or disagreed with these statements:

* If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you.
* Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.
* People on this team sometimes reject others for being different.
* It is safe to take a risk on this team.
* It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help.
* No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts.
* Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized.

In her TEDx talk, Edmondson offers three simple things individuals can do to foster team psychological safety:

* Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.
* Acknowledge your own fallibility.
* Model curiosity and ask lots of questions.

Commit leaders to reinforcing and improving - Get leadership onboard to model and seek continuous improvement can help put into practice your vocabulary.

Psychological safety:

* Solicit input and opinions from the group.
* Share information about personal and work style preferences, and encourage others to do the same.
* Watch Amy Edmondson's TED Talk on psychological safety.

Dependability:

* Clarify roles and responsibilities of team members.
* Develop concrete project plans to provide transparency into every individual’s work.
* Talk about some of the conscientiousness research.

Structure & Clarity:

* Regularly communicate team goals and ensure team members understand the plan for achieving them.
* Ensure your team meetings have a clear agenda and designated leader.
* Consider adopting Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) to organize the team’s work.

Meaning:

* Give team members positive feedback on something outstanding they are doing and offer to help them with something they struggle with.
* Publicly express your gratitude for someone who helped you out.
* Read the KPMG case study on purpose.

Impact:

* Co-create a clear vision that reinforces how each team member’s work directly contributes to the team’s and broader organization's goals.
* Reflect on the work you're doing and how it impacts users or clients and the organization.
* Adopt a user-centered evaluation method and focus on the user.
