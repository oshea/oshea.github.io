Onboarding was something I didn't take seriously in my early days as a founder and manager. I figured I could do the basic setup work, explain the must-know items and throw people into the fire. I only hired great people. They'd figure it out. I couldn't justify the investment in something more thoughtful and comprehensive.

Turns out I was very wrong.

A good onboarding process makes a good first impression. It sets an example for how rigorous, organized, passionate and excellent the new hire should expect to be. Good onboarding helps people ramp up faster, make better decisions and align with mission and culture better. 

It’s a high leverage investment, even  and one of the better knobs for influencing culture. 

Start by creating a comprehensive onboarding checklist to help you be consistent and iterative. This may seem obvious but it’s tempting to just wing it with a smallish team. Don’t. It’s too easy to miss things and forget about important learnings from previous new hires. Use a google doc or spreadsheet as a template and copy it for every hire.

A month after onboarding someone, follow-up and get their feedback. Use this feedback to iterate on the process. Put this on the calendar.

Then there are all the obvious things that most people will do: invites to meetings, adding to slack channels, accounts setup, etc. But those aren't the things that make your onboarding process good.

Here are 3 less obvious tactics that I've found can make a huge difference.

### Have the mission and values talk with a senior leader

Schedule an hour long 1:1 with a founder or at least one senior leader. This should be all about culture, mission and values. I’d argue that this is the most important thing on this list. It should be part presentation and part conversation. The new hire should leave this meeting with a sense for how to think and act in a way that aligns with team values and culture. For example, I usually spend a lot of time talking about 80/20 thinking with specific examples of how to apply it. Other things I usually cover include: psychological safely, not-invented-here syndrome, ownership, ROI of engineering work and customer empathy.

### Give a history lesson in decision making

Share artifacts that will help the new hire understand how the team works. For engineers: information rich retros, design documents, code reviews and RFCs (if you are doing RFCs you should). Share emails, documents or even slack transcripts about important decisions that were made. Tell the story of how your team got to where they are and how they made decisions along the way. This will help define the culture.

### Make onboarding success top priority for a buddy

Assign an onboarding buddy. This person should be directly responsible for making sure the new hire has a good experience. They will help guide them through this process and work closely with them for 30-90 days. For engineers, this will mean a lot of pairing. Make it clear to the buddy that this is likely more important than whatever else they are working on. That is usually not how people feel by default. This should be evaluated as part of their performance review if you do those things.
