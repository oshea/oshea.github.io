## [How to build a meaningful network](https://firstround.com/review/dont-just-network-build-your-meaningful-network-to-maximize-your-impact/)

Everyone has four types of networks: Unfamiliar, Familiar, Intimate, and Meaningful.

It’s your Meaningful Network that will make it possible for you to have the impact with your career and life that you desire.

There are three steps to welcoming more people into your Meaningful Network:
    1. Bringing people from your Unfamiliar Network into your Familiar Network by making initial contact and forming a connection.
    1. Bringing people from your Familiar Network into your Intimate Network by getting to know them well, understanding your commonalities, and finding ways you can be helpful to them.
    1. Bringing people from your Intimate Network into your Meaningful Network by investing in making their life better in an important way.

Your success at building a network is founded on one very important mindset: that you’re doing it based on your desire to know, appreciate, and help other people.

### Unfamiliar → Familiar

Appear warm and friendly. Use open body language. Smile. Make eye contact. Speak confidently.

Practice introducing yourself in the mirror. Make it natural and inviting.

Initiate a brief but enjoyable conversation. Keep it positive and simple.

End the conversation without being awkward...following an exchange of one or two questions and answers, after your new acquaintance finishes a sentence, you can simply stretch out your hand again, smile and say, “I’m so glad to meet you, Joe. I hope to see you and your dog around here again soon.”

Remember the person’s name.

### Familiar → Intimate

We often talk too much about ourselves. Spend more time listening and ask meaningful questions about them.

So don’t talk about yourself. From now on, use every interaction as a chance to appreciate someone else by investigating their work and interests.

Approach conversations with the mindset of a batting practice pitcher in your new friend’s home run derby of personal greatness.

Avoid temptations to talk about yourself. Pivote their questions about you back to them.

If you want to be interesting, be interested.

The second mistake we all make is conversational cowardice. We keep discussions safe and limited to the surface. Liberating yourself from this fear will open the door to thousands of fascinating conversations. Ask questions. Don't worry about looking stupid.

Questions:
    1. Tell me about the business model — who pays whom and who is delivering value to whom?
    1. What advantage do you offer over your competitors that get customers to choose you?
    1. What drew you to work in this particular industry?
    1. How big a piece of the overall business is your division?
    1. Are there new technologies affecting your business?
    1. It sounds like you’ve been successful? What makes someone unsuccessful in the role?
    1. What’s your favorite part of your job and why?

### Intimate → Meaningful

You’re going to do something important for them.

It requires effort and genuine caring for that person.

Share knowledge.

Make connections. Seek to get to know and be useful to folks who sit at important network center points.

Offer support and friendship.


## [How to become insanely well connected](https://firstround.com/review/how-to-become-insanely-well-connected/)

The best way to be highly influential is to be human to everyone you meet.

### 7 Rules for Making Memorable Connections

1. Convey genuine appreciation. Actively project warmth and high energy. Think about what they know that you don’t. 
1. Listen with intent. Being a good listener is about two things: 1) Demonstrating that you’ve heard exactly what was said by the other person, and 2) encouraging them to continue.
1. Use humility markers. Acknowledging your own fallibility and human imperfection can go a long way toward making yourself relatable.
1. Offer unvarnished honesty. You can differentiate yourself by being as honest as you can. Just remember to root your honesty in what will actually have utility for the other party. 
1. Blue-sky brainstorm. If you can change the angle or way they’re thinking about something by openly brainstorming with them, you make them feel like they got something special and unexpected. 
1. End every meeting or conversation with the feeling and optimism you’d like to have at the start of your next conversation with the person. 
1. Don't fake it till you make it. You need to know exactly why you care about that person or their company. This doesn’t happen by magic. It happens because your sincerity is clearly powered by diligent preparation.

Create mini dossiers on people that you will or do meet:
    - What are the key milestones in their career?
    - What expertise do they seemingly love to provide? (Possible to suss out from any articles that quote them or talks they’ve given in the past.)
    - Are there any recent news stories or announcements about them?
    - What do you want to ask them or get out of the interaction if you get the chance?

DO: Keep your ‘dream contact list’ at the ready. 

DO: Craft low-lift requests.

DO: Follow up and follow through.

Actually doing what you say you're going to do will put you in the top quartile.

DO: Make your own system for keeping in touch. Set reminders to follow-up regularly.

DO: Special Ops-level recon

DO: Get to the ‘Zone of Indifference

DON’T: Ambush people (always ask first)

DON’T: Reach out only when you need something

DON’T: Lose track of your response rate. You don't want your response rate be at 100%, because then you're not pushing far enough — you could probably ask for more assistance and still get it. "My goal is roughly an 80% hit rate for outreach,"
