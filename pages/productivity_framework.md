__“I must create a system or be enslaved by another man’s”__ — William Blake

### Goals

Constantly try use my time effectively. Work on ways to achieve better focus on the most important projects. Do a 'good enough' job on everything else.

Take a long term view:
- What are my responsibilities and goals?
- What KPIs am I trying to maximize?
- Always be optimizing
- Say no to things that aren't high value

### Strategy and habits

- Do 2 minute tasks immediately.
- Limit email reading to 3-4 low energy times per day.
- Touch each email only once. Triage quickly and decisively into one of my other systems.
- Do weekly and daily planning with my TODO list.
- Use Evernote for a GTD like system with 3 lists: today (daily note), this week (daily note), later (projects).
- Get to Inbox Zero everyday. Use snoozing for follow-ups. Don't use email as task list.
- Use my calendar to schedule events and block times to complete high value tasks, goals and build good habits.
- Use Streaks to track most important habits and goals.
- Work on delegating and automating: trust and clearly communicate process and goals.

Things to try:
- Put links to email in my todo list and archive them. Can't use Inbox for this.

### Daily Task List and Notes

Use daily Evernote docs for this. Follow this process every day:

1. Copy the previous day's note
1. Remove the tasks completed the previous day
1. Make any changes before starting the day's work.
1. Reorganize and reorder the list to reflect current priorities
1. Highlight the things that I must do that day
1. Use the daily note to capture new tasks and ideas throughout the day

When adding or prioritizing a task or next action, you should consider if it takes less than two minutes to do it. If this is the case, do it. Right away.

Use Projects, Waiting For and Maybe notes for stuff that doesn't belong on the daily notes.

Do a weekly review of all lists and notes. Use a Triggers note to make sure I'm working on and advancing the important things.

### Goals

Keep them in the daily evernote docs so they can be reviewed and possibly edited every day.

### Events and Reminders

Use Reminders app to remind me of errands or quick todos that I need to do in the future.

For large projects or work reminders use my work calendar and schedule blocks of time to do the work.

### Procrastinating on a task

* Try to do important and unpleasant tasks first thing in the morning during project time. Tackle the most difficult task first.
* Set a 5 min timer and force myself to get started. That's the hard part.
* Limit how much time you spend on the task.
* Change the way I think about the task.
* Time myself to make it a game.
* Think about the cost of procrastinating.
* Clearly define that small tasks required to complete the big task.
* Schedule time to do it on the calendar.

Say to myself, “I’ll feel better when I handle this.” Repeat it like a mantra until the urge to procrastinate passes.

“If you know you have to swallow a frog, swallow it first thing in the morning. If there are two frogs, swallow the big one first.” - Mark Twain

### Daily habits

Have 2-3 most important goals for the day. Always start the day by working on these (swallow the frog).

Try to timebox high priority projects whenever possible.

Try to follow the basic GTD approach.

### Focus Sessions

When working on projects or I have flex time, use 30-45 work bursts with a pomodoro timer.

Try to carve out sessions of uninterrupted work without getting up, seeing notifications or engaging in any other activities (checking email, web, etc.).

Try to group these together in 1-2 hour focused sessions. Shoot for 1-3 of these per day.

### Projects and todos repository

Use daily notes for keeping todos that aren't projects and as an inbox for processing new items.

Use a Projects note

### Email

Try to keep work email at Inbox 0 at the end of the day.

Don't use email as my task list. Requires too much re-processing.

Try not to read emails twice.

Disable notifications and close my email tab unless I'm process and respond to email. 

Use snoozing to push off stuff that I want to deal with at a later date.

### Notifications

Try to turn off distracting notifications.

Calendar reminders should be the only thing that interrupts me throughout the day.

### Journaling

Rate productiveness and make note of insights at the end of the day.

### Important ideas

Stages of time management maturity:
- Stage 1: Clear your mind and day. Control time killers (todos, email, meetings)
 - Write things down to clear your mind.
 - The more you have on a list, the less likely you are to use it.
 - Only one task list
 - 3 priorities: today, this week, later
 - Limit email reading time to 3-4 low energy times a day
- Stage 2: Automate and delegate
- Stage 3: Taking a long term view
