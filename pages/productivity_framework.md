### Overall Strategy

Constantly try use my time effectively. Constantly strive for the ideal flow state where my focus and attention is being used wisely.

Use Evernote for a GTD like system.

Use Inbox Zero + snoozing to manage communications.

Use my calendar to schedule events and times to complete high value tasks, goals and reminders to create good habits.

### Daily Task List and Notes

Use daily Evernote docs for this. Follow this process every day:

1. Copy the previous day's note
1. Remove the tasks completed the previous day
1. Make any changes before starting the day's work.
1. Reorganize and reorder the list to reflect current priorities
1. Highlight the things that I must do that day
1. Use the daily note to capture new tasks and ideas throughout the day

When adding or prioritizing a task or next action, you should consider if it takes less than two minutes to do it. If this is the case, do it. Right away.

Use Projects, Waiting For and Maybe notes for stuff that doesn't belong on the daily notes.

Do a weekly review of all lists and notes. Use a Triggers note to make sure I'm working on and advancing the important things.

### Goals

Keep them in the daily evernote docs so they can be reviewed and possibly edited every day.

### Habits

Use Streaks to track most important habits and goals.

### Events and Reminders

Use Reminders app to remind me of errands or quick todos that I need to do in the future.

For large projects or work reminders use my work calendar and schedule blocks of time to do the work.

### Procrastinating on a task

* Try to do important and unpleasant tasks first thing in the morning during project time. Tackle the most difficult task first.
* Set a 5 min timer and force myself to get started. That's the hard part.
* Limit how much time you spend on the task.
* Change the way I think about the task.
* Time myself to make it a game.
* Think about the cost of procrastinating.
* Clearly define that small tasks required to complete the big task.
* Schedule time to do it on the calendar.

Say to myself, “I’ll feel better when I handle this.” Repeat it like a mantra until the urge to procrastinate passes.

“If you know you have to swallow a frog, swallow it first thing in the morning. If there are two frogs, swallow the big one first.” - Mark Twain

### Daily habits

Have 2-3 most important goals for the day. Always start the day by working on these (swallow the frog).

Try to timebox high priority projects whenever possible.

Try to follow the basic GTD approach.

### Focus Sessions

When working on projects or I have flex time, use 30-45 work bursts with a pomodoro timer.

Try to carve out sessions of uninterrupted work without getting up, seeing notifications or engaging in any other activities (checking email, web, etc.).

Try to group these together in 1-2 hour focused sessions. Shoot for 1-3 of these per day.

### Projects and todos repository

Use daily notes for keeping todos that aren't projects and as an inbox for processing new items.

Use a Projects note

### Email

Try to keep work email at Inbox 0 at the end of the day.

Disable notifications and close my email tab unless I'm process and respond to email. 

Use snoozing to push off stuff that I want to deal with at a later date.

### Notifications

Try to turn off distracting notifications.

Calendar reminders should be the only thing that interrupts me throughout the day.

### Journaling

Rate productiveness and make note of insights at the end of the day.
