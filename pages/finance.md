## [How To Preserve and Grow Your Wealth – Michael Flaxman – Medium](https://medium.com/@michaelflaxman/how-to-preserve-and-grow-your-wealth-e49c8fcaf33)

Regardless of what you invest in, you should start by thinking hard about risk, diversification, and minimizing taxes/fees.

You can often generate higher returns by taking on risk, but it’s not a free lunch. Most people want to chase risk when the market is up and are afraid to take on risk when it’s down.

Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. - Buffet

Most investors become more risk averse as their net worth increases. Once you have more money than you need, you focus on not losing it.

you should probably take less risk as you get closer to retirement.

In order to achieve diversification in the stock market you need to have a portfolio with many stocks in it; economists disagree on the exact number, but suggest at common guidelines is at least 40 companies. The odds you know more than the market for that many positions approach 0%, so one way to diversify is through the use of index funds.

VTI has an expense ratio of a minuscule 0.04% / year. (https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI)

An import disclaimer is that most rich people became wealthy by beating the market where they had expertise. If you’re confident your investments are going to outperform then it may be worth the extra risk to limit your diversification and focus on winners.

Fees can have a big impact on long term returns and they are often hidden. Make sure you understand them well. Taxes are the biggest fees.

If you have < $100k USD in the market, I’d recommend using a robo-advisor service...their fees are very affordable (for smaller investors). 

Market timing comes with some large problems:
- When the market is down and nobody is investing, will you be comfortable writing that check? For this reason, having an entry/exit strategy and sticking to it is often a wise choice.
- During bear markets, the best investments may be unproductive assets 

 The stock market has historically been a fantastic investment, and in the long run is effectively a bet on human productivity.

While index funds are a fantastic way to get broad exposure with low taxes and fees, market-capitalization weighting means that during a crash investors may find themselves over-exposed to the priciest stocks.

A general rule of thumb for stocks vs bonds is based on age: % of Portfolio in Stocks = 120 - Your Age

The US Government sells Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) that shield you from purchasing power loss:
- You believe other asset types are going to crash.

You might be better off deploying some of the cash in investments you think will perform well in a recession. For example, I bought COST stock in 2017.

You have come into a large amount of money at one time (e.g. an inheritance or the sale of a large investment) and you don’t want to try to time the market. You might do better deploying 10–30% of it per month in case the market collapses the day after you make your investments. 

but a much simpler and lower fee approach is to hold some percentage of your portfolio in cash.

*It only makes sense to hoard cash if you plan to deploy those cash reserves aggressively during a downturn. There’s no reason to be punished for holding cash in good times unless you’re going to use it in bad times.*

A general target is<40% of your portfolio in real estate, preferably spread out across multiple properties, potentially even in different geographies.

One way to get exposure to real estate is through a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). These investments generate passive income and pay out at least 90% of it as taxable income.

The benefits of investing in REITs vs owning property directly:
- Diversification
- Don’t have to be a landlord, make improvements, deal with tenants or admin work
- Accounting is simple and done for you

Bitcoin offers returns that may be uncorrelated to the market, but like gold it is an unproductive asset. 

Holding 2–5% of your portfolio in bitcoin is probably a wise idea in case it eclipses gold (or one day even becomes the world’s reserve currency). 

These are the drivers of startup opportunities:
1. New technology. The internet/mobile wave has passed. Now, there’s bitcoin, 3d printing, VR, etc. It feels much more niche than what’s come in the past (society moving to a digital world), though I do love bitcoin.
1. Increase or decrease in government interference, which is generally making something legal (marijuana) or illegal (green energy benefiting from subsidies). Can border on shameful cronyism, and is relatively niche. In the case of subsidies, even government money isn’t enough to guarantee success (see Solyndra).
1. Cultural change. These are hard to predict and generally smaller as culture shifts slowly. Uber/AirBnB are good examples here, though this is not usually strong enough; you need a combination with one of the above to create large opportunities.

If you want exposure to this asset class, your best bet is probably to be an LP in a VC fund. 

Hedge funds were originally a mechanism to hedge risk by going long in one position/vertical and short in another, often while taking on lots of leverage. They charge high fees, typically ~2% annual management fee + 20% of performance.

Minimizing your tax liabilities can lead to a dramatic increase in your bottom line.

Tax-advantaged accounts (sometimes called “qualified plans”) provide two benefits: Instead of paying taxes on dividends (for investments held) or capital gains (when trading) each year, you only pay taxes when you withdraw from your retirement account (or in the case of a ROTH IRA never as you already paid taxes on those funds when you contributed). There are often tax benefits for participation. If you’re an employee, you can contribute up to $18,500/year of your salary to your 401k as of 2018 and your employer can elect to make matching contributions of up to $36.5k/year as of 2018 (though few employers do), for a combined total 401k contribution limit of $55k.

A good tactic is to invest in assets that generate a lot of income, capital gains (especially short-term capital gains), and dividend payments, via your tax-advantaged account; you’ll get the benefit of diversifying into those investments without the tax consequences. 

If you have a capital loss (i.e. you sell an investment for less than your cost basis), you can usually apply it against another capital gain to reduce your tax bill. If capital losses exceed capital gains in a given year, you can apply up to $3,000 as of 2018 of this excess loss to offset against your income, which is even better as ordinary income is taxed at a much higher rate than capital gains. 

If you have a position that is worth less than when you bought it, it is generally considered a “wash sale” if you sell it and then buy it back within 30 days, so don’t do this.

In the simplest scenario, if you deploy a lot of cash and then see the price go down substantially, you may want to harvest some of those losses right away.

The US has a system of progressive taxation, which means that generally the more you make the more you pay. This is true for both income and capital gains.

One strange result of this, is that it’s usually better to make $X each year for 2 years vs 2 * $X in one year. The reason is that you may end up paying more taxes overall.

So, if you have a long-term stable asset with > $426k in unrealized gains (or less if you have income) and you want to sell it, you may be better off to split the sale across multiple years as a form of dollar-cost averaging.

The only exception is that if you live abroad, then the first ~$104k of your foreign income is tax-free as of 2018. 

Puerto Rico is unusual in that bona-fide residents can pay $0 in federal income tax by living in the territory. Territory taxes can be as low as just ~4%, which is an absolutely massive discount and much greater savings vs moving to a state without state income taxes.

You must commit to being a resident of the territory for 10 years. In theory, if you move back to the mainland you might have to pay back the tax savings, though I’m not sure how often this is enforced.

The best choice is probably Vanguard; as a mutual company they have long-term interests that are aligned with their customers. However, Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Merrill Lynch all have > $500 BN AUM (some much more), so they’re probably safe as well.

It is unwise to keep all your eggs in one basket, but brokerages may be an exception.

It’s best to avoid selling winning positions as that’s a taxable event, and instead just top-up your under-performers with post-tax dollars 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures cash in your bank account for up to $250k in losses as of 2018. 

You probably shouldn’t hold more than $250k in a bank account anyway, but if you need to then a “Deposit Sweep Program” may be ideal for you.
