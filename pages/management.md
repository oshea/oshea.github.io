## Important Ideas

- Leadership is about repeating goals and values over and over until everyone starts repeating them back to you.
- Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors. The challenge is aligning people with the goal of the organization and the customer.

- A vector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction.
- Add up the sums of all employee vectors and that new vector is basically the direction and momentum your company is moving.
- Every person is a vector — add them all up, and you know how much progress your company is going to make.
- If you have perfectly awesome people and they’re perfectly misaligned, the result is zero progress.
- You can make more progress with the amazing people you already have simply by better aligning vectors.
