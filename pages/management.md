## Important Ideas

- Don't delegate tasks and activities. Delegate outcomes and let your team figure out how to get there on their own. Be very good at clearly defining desired outcomes. Let your team contribute in thinking about what those outcomes are and how to measure them.

- Part of leadership is repeating goals and values over and over until everyone starts repeating them back to you.

- Invest in your best people. Spend the most time with them. Don't spend too much time trying to fix your worst performers.

- Not everyone needs the same style of management. Adjust your approach depending on their style.

- Focus people on getting better at the things they are good at. Don't push people into doing things they aren't good at if needed.


- Things that impact culture:
    - hiring/firing people to create a team that embodies core values
    - onboarding
    - how decisions are made 
    - alignment
    - promotions/rewards and management.

- Things that people need to be happy and productive employees:
    - they know the impact of their work
    - feel autonomy in the decisions they make every day
    - structure to keep team members engaged for the long-term
    - management actively listens to feedback
    - clear paths for personal growth is defined
    - leaders that are trained to support their teams

- Thinks that make teams effective:
    -  Psychological safety: no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.
    -  Dependability: members reliably complete quality work on time and meet a high bar with their work
    -  Structure and clarity: team has clear roles, plans and goals 
    -  Meaning: work is personally important to team members
    -  Impact: team members think their work matters and creates change

- Thinks that don't have a big impact on making teams effectiveness:
    - Colocation of teammates (sitting together in the same office)
    - Consensus-driven decision making
    - Extroversion of team members
    - Individual performance of team members
    - Workload size
    - Seniority
    - Team size
    - Tenure

### [Decision making at Coinbase](https://medium.com/@barmstrong/how-we-make-decisions-at-coinbase-cd6c630322e9)

- Core values include clear communication and efficient execution.
- 3 Step process:
  - Set the parameters: decision date, revisit date (how long to commit to decision), decision makers, who provides input, who is affected,
  - Deliberate: get decisions makers and input providers in a room to share data, enumerate the options, present any data that's been gathered, one round of blind voting, discuss pros/cons and why people voted the way they did, do a final vote
  - Decide: make the decision, communicate it and memorialize it
- Good decision making:
  - People seek the truth, aren't just trying to be right
  - Decision makers are clear and chosen in advance
  - Everyone is heard and commits to the decision
  - Make quickly with few meetings using a lightweight process
  - A record is kept of the process
- Give owners unilateral decision making ability unless a decision is high risk: long term implications or costly to unwind the wrong decision
- “A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.” -Gen. George S. Patton
- Things to avoid:
  - A bunch of one-off conversations
  - Manager not delegating decisions or overruling decision they disagree with
  - Waiting too long to make a decision
  - List options and debating them at the same time
  - Trying to run a fully democratic process

### [Delegate outcomes, not activities](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/delegate-outcomes-not-activities-3aa922c1f55e)

- Delegation is about letting your report learn, and if you believe their approach has a fair chance to get to the outcome, then you must get out of the way.
- When you delegate the outcomes and not the activities, you help employees not just execute for the task at hand, but equip them for every future task after that. You’re giving true ownership to your team.

### [Every employee is a vector](https://thinkgrowth.org/what-elon-musk-taught-me-about-growing-a-business-c2c173f5bff3)

- A vector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction.
- Add up the sums of all employee vectors and that new vector is basically the direction and momentum your company is moving.
- Every person is a vector — add them all up, and you know how much progress your company is going to make.
- If you have perfectly awesome people and they’re perfectly misaligned, the result is zero progress.
- You can make more progress with the amazing people you already have simply by better aligning vectors.

### [Thoughts on building culture](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-build-great-startup-culture-fred-stevens-smith/)

- Culture is not designed. It is a mirror that reflects back the collective personality of the team.
- Hiring and firing is the biggest lever to influence culture.
- Hiring skilled people that are bad for culture is a mistake.
- Don't use the beer test or if you'd want to hang out with someone to decide if they are a cultural fit.
- Use **core values** to evaluate if people will fit in with the culture you are building.
- Rules for creating core values:
  - You should only have 3.
  - Values shouldn't be aspirational. They should describe the reality of your team.
  - Your values should be the things you work harder on than any other company.
- Operationalize your core values: hire people that embody your values. Fire people that don't.
- Other things that impact culture:
  - how the founders run the business
  - onboarding process
  - how work is assigned (e.g., based on people’s development goals v. purely what company needs)
  - who gets recognized/rewarded/promoted (and for what)
  - how decisions are made, how managers behave and the tools they use to motivate their teams (vision/caring v fear/carrots/sticks).
  - the degree of alignment between the company’s mission, the strategy, the team’s capabilities, the way resources are allocated, the everyday activities and the market needs will also be felt in the culture
