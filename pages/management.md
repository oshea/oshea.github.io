## Important Ideas

- Leadership is about repeating goals and values over and over until everyone starts repeating them back to you.
- Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors. The challenge is aligning people with the goal of the organization and the customer.
- Things that impact culture: hiring/firing people to create a team that embodies core values, onboarding, how decisions are made, alignment, promotions/rewards and management.

### [Every employee is a vector](https://thinkgrowth.org/what-elon-musk-taught-me-about-growing-a-business-c2c173f5bff3)

- A vector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction.
- Add up the sums of all employee vectors and that new vector is basically the direction and momentum your company is moving.
- Every person is a vector — add them all up, and you know how much progress your company is going to make.
- If you have perfectly awesome people and they’re perfectly misaligned, the result is zero progress.
- You can make more progress with the amazing people you already have simply by better aligning vectors.

### [Thoughts on building culture](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-build-great-startup-culture-fred-stevens-smith/)

- Culture is not designed. It is a mirror that reflects mack the collective personality of the team.
- Hiring and firing is the biggest lever to influence culture.
- Hiring skilled people that are bad for culture is a mistake.
- Don't use the beer test or if you'd want to hang out with someone to decide if they are a cultural fit.
- Use **core values** to evaluate if people will fit in with the culture you are building.
- Rules for creating core values:
  - You should only have 3.
  - Values shouldn't be aspirational. They should describe the reality of your team.
  - Your values should be the things you work harder on than any other company.
- Operationalize your core values: hire people that embody your values. Fire people that don't.
- Other things that impact culture:
  - how the founders run the business
  - onboarding process
  - how work is assigned (e.g., based on people’s development goals v. purely what company needs)
  - who gets recognized/rewarded/promoted (and for what)
  - how decisions are made, how managers behave and the tools they use to motivate their teams (vision/caring v fear/carrots/sticks).
  - the degree of alignment between the company’s mission, the strategy, the team’s capabilities, the way resources are allocated, the everyday activities and the market needs will also be felt in the culture
