## Ideas for business communication

- Use the **Pyramid Principle** for structured communication: 1) Present the answer, conclusion or recommendation first 2) Group and summarize supporting arguments 3) Logically order your supporting ideas.
  - Ideas in writing should always form a pyramid under a single thought.
  - Ideas at any level must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.
  - The magic number of ideas in a group is 3.
  - Logically group ideas by time order, structural order or importance order.
- Use the **Rule of 3**: present 3 ideas when trying to persuade someone. It's memorable, decisive and organized.

## Meeting new people

- When meeting new people:
  - Start with a smile, open body language and eye contact
  - Mirror their communication style (loud, quiet, aggressive, subdued, calm)
  - Start with open ended questions that elicit more than a yes/no response
  - Practice active listening (eye contact, engaged response)
  - Try to understand what the person really cares about
