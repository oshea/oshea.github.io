### Overall Strategy

Constantly try use my time effectively. Constantly strive for the ideal flow state where my focus and attention is being used wisely.

### Daily Todo List and Notes

Use daily evernote docs. Every day copy the previous day's doc and make any changes before starting the day's work.

### Goals

Keep them in the daily evernote docs so they can be reviewed and possibly edited every day.

### Habits

Use Streaks to track most important habits and goals.

### Events and Reminders

Use Reminders app to remind me of errands or quick todos that I need to do in the future.

For large projects or work reminders use my work calendar and schedule blocks of time to do the work.

### Daily habits

Have 2-3 most importart goals for the day. ALWAYS GET THESE DONE FIRST (FOCUS ON SPEED).

Try to timebox these high priority project whenever possible.

Use 30-45 work bursts with a pomodoro timer. Try to carve out sessions of uninterrupted work without getting up, seeing notifications or engaging in any other activities (checking email, web, etc.). Try to group these together in 1-2 hour focus sessions. Shoot for 1-3 of these per day.

Try to follow the basic GTD approach:

### Projects and todos repository

For now, use Todoist for my backlog of projects, todos and goals. This list should not be time high priority or time sensitive.

### Email

Try to keep work email at Inbox 0.Â Use Starring and Scheduling (Outlook app) to keep primary inbox empty.

### Notifications

Try to turn off distracting notifications whenever possible.

### Daily log by hour

Currently trying this experiment to see how it goes.
