# Turn the Ship Around

Success of top-down, leader-follower structure can be effective when measured over the short term, but the not the long term.

Questions asked when learning about the org and and it's people:
- What are things you are hoping I don't change?
- What are things you are secretly hoping I do change?
- What are the good things we should build on?
- If you were me, what would you do first?
- What isn't the org doing better?
- What are your personal goals?
- What impediments do you have to doing your job well?
- What will be our biggest challenge?
- What are your biggest frustrations?
- What is the best thing I can do for you?

**Learn to appreciate your people but also demand excellence from them.**

Common trap: Avoiding mistakes can become the driver of all actions. Satisfying the minimum requirements and ignoring anything beyond that.

Is there a call to action in the org? Are things too comfortable? Is there complacency? Do people shoot for excellence or try to protect themselves?

Leadership should retain accountability for performance but release control of the actual decisions to the directors, managers and ICs.

Is your org spending more time avoiding errors than trying to achieve excellence?

There is no incentive or reward for developing mechanisms that enable excellence beyond the short term cycle of evaluation.

Radically change the daily motivation by shifting focus from avoiding errors to achieving excellence.

**Mechanism: achieve excellence, don't just avoid errors**

If we are overly focused on errors and how to fix them we evaluate based on mistakes. Debilitating when it becomes the objective of the organization.

Goal: divest control and distribute it to the managers and ICs. Control is about making decisions and how we work and toward what end (leader-leader).

Focus on following procedure can be limiting. 

**Mechanism: find the generic code for control and rewrite it**

Sole output of a cultural change effort needs to be mechanisms that endure and embed to make the changes lasting.

First step: delegate control and decision making as much as is comfortable.

Make it clear who is responsible for every thing that goes on. Delegate that responsibility as far down as is possible.

Just delegating isn't enough - it will require new decisions makes to have knowledge and org purpose that they might not have.

**Mechanism: Act your way to new thinking**

How to embed cultural change: 
- Ask people to fill out cards statements that say: 'I'd know if we achieved [some cultural change] if I saw employees...'
- Allow time for people to read and think about everyone's suggestions
- Sort and prioritize the cards
- Discuss how to code the behavior into the companies practices. 
- Write the new practices into the companies procedure

Help the team create a collective sense of responsibility.

Vague understanding of goals can result in wasted time.

**Mechanism: Short, early conversations make efficient work** 

Give the team early feedback on how they tackle problems, but allow them to retain control of the solution. Help provide clarity to the team about what they are trying to accomplish.

Even a 30 second check early could save hours later on. Have these discussion early and often to make sure projects are on track.

Have people state their intentions regularly with 'I intend to...' statements.

**Mechanism: Use 'I intend to...' to turn passive followers into active leaders**

This can profoundly shift ownership when people are no longer asking for permission.

Encourage people to say:
- I intend to...
- I plan to...
- I will...
- We will...

And not:
- I would like to...
- Can I...
- Could we...
- What should I do about...
- Do you think we should...

Ask people what the boss might considering after an 'I intend to...' to get people thinking at a higher level.

**GOAL: always be pushing people to think like leadership thinks about problems**

**As the level of control is divested it becomes more and more important the team be aligned with the goal of the organization.**

**Mechanism: Resist the urge to provide solutions.**

When you follow the leader-leader model you must take time to let others react to the situation as well. Create a space for open decisions by the entire team. 

How often do issues that require decisions come up on short notice? If this happens a lot you have a reactive organization. If quick decisions are required by the boss then the team isn't learning.

Things to try to get the team thinking for themselves:
- If the decision needs to be make urgently make it and then have the team "red-team" the decision and evaluate it.
- If the decisions needs to be made soon, ask for brief input then make the decision.
- If the the decision can be delayed, force the team to provide inputs. Do not force consensus - cherish dissension.

**Mechanism: eliminate top down monitoring systems**

Implement mechanisms that actually give ownership. Avoid systems where senior people are determining what junior people should be doing.

**Adhering to processes can become the objective, instead of achieving the objective the process was put in place to achieve. The goal becomes to avoid errors and when errors are made more process is added. These additional monitors don't actually achieve the objective, just police the process.**

Informal communication is needed to make leader-leader work. Encourage a constant buzz of discussions. Monitor the buzz more than the content. Signal of how well the team is working together and sharing information.

**Mechanism: think out loud**

Encourage everyone to constantly be sharing what they saw, thoughts, believed, we skeptical about, feared, worried about, planned to do and worried about.

**Mechanism: embrace the inspectors. Be open and invite outside criticism**

Moving control to more junior team members is not enough. There needs to be a focus on technical competence.

**Mechanism: take deliberate action**

Created a mechanism for engaging the brain before active. We want people to act deliberately. 

Was single most powerful mechanism for reducing mistakes and being operationally excellent.

It applies at the moment someone signs responds to a message, writes a line of code, authorized an action or enters a keystroke.

Have operators pause and vocalize what they are going to do, it allows others to step in and correct before a mistake is made.

**Control without competence is chaos**

Probe the team for the their level of knowledge of certain things.

There is an extra burden for competence when authority is delegated.

Have a credo that people learn to get better at their jobs each day.

**Mechanism: We learn (everywhere, all the time)**

Have a training program that people want to go to:
- Goal is to increase technical competence
- Ability to delegate increased decision making to employees
- Results in great engagement, motivation and initiative
- Ask team to fill in this statement: 'Our org would be more effective if [level of employee] could make decisions about [subject]'
- What do people need to know to be able to make those decisions?
- That will leave you with a relevant list of topics for training. Directly connect training topics to increased employee decision making and control.
- What areas of the biz are marred with mistakes because lower level employess don't have competence to make good decisions?
- How could you implement a we learn policy among staff?
- Are people eager to go to your training?

**Mechanism: don't brief, certify**

A certification is different because the person in charge is asking questions. At the end the leader determines if the team is ready to perform a project. Make sure the team knows it is a decision meeting about if they team is ready..

This will get people to be more prepared. Studying. Creating ownership and employee engagement. 

**What would it take to start certifying that your project teams know what the goals are and how they are to tackle them?**

**Mechanism: continually and consistently repeat the message**

Repeat the same message day after day, meeting after meeting, event after event.

**Mechanism: specify goals, not mechanisms**

Once people are freed up from following a prescribed way of doing things, they will come up with better approaches and techniques.

How we can ensure adherence with a process while at the same time make the objective the most important thing on everyone's mind?

Clarity means everyone in the org clearly and completely understands what the org is about.

**Mechanism: build trust and take care of your people**

Taking care of people does not mean protecting them from the consequences of their behavior. It mean give them every available tool and advantage to achieve their goals.

**Mechanism: use your legacy for inspiration**

_Do your guiding principles help people in the org make decisions?_

Criteria: if you are an IC and faced with 2 paths, will the org guiding principles help them chose the right path?

**Mechanism: use guiding principles for decision criteria**

**Mechanism: use immediate recognition to reinforce desired behaviors**

Are you mired in short term thinking? 

**Mechanism: Begin with the end in mind**

Leave time in one-on-ones and team meetings to focus on goals and the future. Have a plan and make things measurable for each individual.

Develop longer term organization goals for the next 3-5 years.

**Mechanism: encourage a questioning attitude over blind obedience**

Will your people follow an order that is not correct?

**Mechanism: don't empower, emancipate (recognize genius and capability of your people)**

_If you ask people what authorities they would like to make their jobs easier, you will definitely get some ideas_
