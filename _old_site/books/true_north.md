Discover your True North by Bill George

Preface: The Remarkable Legacy of Warren Bennis

 Just as Peter Drucker was the father of mgmt, Bennis was the father of leadership. Leadership is not a set of genetic characteristics, but the result of a lifelong process of self-discovery. Leaders are made rather than born. Leadership is character. Timeless leadership is always about character, and it is always about authenticity.

Foreword

The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker and On Becoming a Leader by Warren Bennis.

Introduction

Leadership starts with being authentic, the genuine you. True North -- the internal compass that guides you successfully through life. Derived from your most deeply held beliefs, values, and principles you lead by. It is your internal compass, unique to you, that represents who you are at your deepest level. Discovering your True North takes a lifetime of commitment and learning.

The most important thing about leadership is your character and values that guide your life. Best way to define a man’s character: seek out particular mental or moral attitude. He felt himself most deeply/intensely active/alive.  This is the real me.

Today authenticity is seen as the gold standard for leadership. No longer about developing charisma, emulating other leaders, looking good externally, acting in one’s self interest, as was so often the case in the late twentieth century. Old notion of leaders as the smartest guys in the room has been replaced by leaders with high levels of emotional intelligence (EQ). Rather than waiting to get to the top to become leaders, they looked for every opportunity to lead and develop themselves. The reality is that no one can be authentic by trying to be like someone else.

In business, trust is the coin of the realm. Success of any org depends on customers’ trust in products they buy, employees’ trust in leaders, investors’ trust in those who steward their funds, and public trust in capitalism as a fair and equitable means of creating wealth for all. The hardest person you will ever have to lead is yourself.

Authentic leaders have discovered their True North, align people around a shared purpose and values, and empower them to lead authentically to create value for all stakeholders. Yet by acknowledging their shortcomings and admitting their errors, letting humanity and vulnerability come through, they are able to connect with people and inspire them.

Part One: Your Journey to Leadership

Your life story is your foundation. It shapes how you, as a human being, see the world. 3 topics:
How you frame your life story. Reflection/introspection will help you understand your life experiences, and in some cases reframe them.
Risk of losing your way. Examine 5 archetypes that can cause you to lose your way.
Role of crucibles in shaping your leadership. How you deal with your greatest adversities, most painful experiences present greatest opportunities for personal growth.

Your Life Story

Journey to authentic leadership begins with understanding yourself: life stories. Crucibles, setbacks. You must have the courage to follow an unconventional path. You can’t value/measure life experience in the moment, because you never know when you’re going to find the true path that enables you to find your voice.

Diversity of skills is an important element of any effective team. There is no way that leaders who surround themselves with people just like them can be effective. We need to recognize our weakness, but not amplify them, and then surround ourselves with people whose strengths complement our weaknesses.

Lack the introspection to connect the dots between their life experiences and goals they are pursuing now. Can you connect the dots between your past and future to find inspiration to lead authentically? What people/experiences have shaped you? What have been key turning points in your life. Where in your story do you find your passion to lead?

Character forms/people act as individual contributors or lead teams for the first time. We begin life on a linear path where success is based on clear targets. Life gets complicated when targets aren’t clear and you have to set your own. By rubbing up against the world, you get to know yourself. Either do that or you’re going to spend your life serving the interests and expectations of others. Ask yourself “what do you want out of your life?”

2nd phase of leadership journey begins with a rapid accumulation of leadership experiences. These periods transform your understanding of what leadership is all about and can dramatically accelerate your development. Many leaders face experiences at work that dramatically test their sense of self, values, or assumptions about their careers. “Hitting the wall”

Examine your life story, leadership opportunities to this point.
Looking at patterns from your early life story, what people/events/experiences have had the greatest impact on you and your life?
In which experiences did you find the greatest inspiration and passion for your leadership?
Do the failures/disappointments you experienced earlier in life constrain you even today, or have you been able to reframe them as learning experiences?
Do you think you need to make any adjustments to your personal and leadership development as a result? If so, what are they?

II. Losing Your Way

Unfortunately, many leaders do not ground themselves in their life stories. Instead, they try to bury their past, and put on a new mask. Or they get caught up in chasing the world’s esteem by trying to accumulate money/fame/power rather than pursuing their intrinsic motivations.

There is nothing wrong with desiring these outward symbols if, and only if, they are balanced by a deeper desire to serve something greater than yourself.

Role of leaders: not to get other people to follow them but to empower other people to lead. They cannot elicit the best performance from their teams if they are in the game primarily for themselves. In the end, poor leaders’ self-centeredness keeps other people from leading.

III. Crucibles

Maslow found that tragedy/trauma were the most important human learning experiences leading to self-actualization. Crucible is an essential element in the process of becoming a leader. Some magic takes place in the crucible of leadership, whether a transformational experience like Mandela’s years in prison, or a relatively painless experience such as being mentored. Whatever is thrown at them, leaders emerge from their crucibles stronger and unbroken.

New research shows that traumatic experiences can result in post-traumatic growth (PTG) as often as PTSD. Similar to Algorta’s metaphor of the oyster pearl, PTG starts by recognizing the uncertainties in life and embracing them as fundamental tenets of human existence. Self awareness and a desire to undertake personal change. Finally. PTG requires acknowledging personal responsibility for the choices you make in life.

I hadn’t yet learned the lessons of mindfulness meditation from expert Jon Kabat-Zinn’s book Wherever You Go, There You Are. I came to grips with my shortcomings and began to focus on others instead of myself. As I gradually became more self-aware, I was chosen to lead many organizations.

Write freely about your greatest crucible, and describe:
How you felt at the time
The resources you called upon to get through it
How you resolved the issues, if you have
How this experience shaped you and your views about the world
How can you use these experiences to reframe your life story and understand yourself and your life more fully?
Are there ways in which these experiences are holding you back today?

Part Two: Developing as an Authentic Leader

We learned that there are five essential elements in your personal development: self-awareness, values, sweet spot, support team, integrated life.


Leadership Element
Key Challenge
Self-Awareness
How can I increase my self-awareness through introspection and feedback?
Values
What are my most deeply held values? What principles guide my leadership?
Sweet Spot
How can I find my sweet spot that integrates my motivations and greatest capabilities?
Support Team
Whom can I count on to guide and support me along the way?
Integrated Life
How can I integrate all aspects of my life and find fulfillment?

IV. Self-Awareness

Self-awareness is the foundation of authenticity, and thus it is at the center of your compass. You develop it by exploring your life story and then understanding the meaning of your crucibles. You need to understand who you are at a deeper level. Embrace the recognition that a good life must go beyond the first two metrics of money and power, and include well-being, wisdom, wonder, and giving.

Without being aware of your vulnerabilities, fears, and longings, it is easy to go off the track of your True North, and others can take advantage of you. Reflect on experiences through introspection and get feedback from those who know you best. Emotional intelligence (EQ) is more important for authentic leaders. Five areas essential to high EQ: self-awareness, self-regulation, social skill, empathy, and motivation. IQ 120, EQ becomes more important in predicting leaders’ success. Most difficult thing in becoming self-aware is to see ourselves as others see us. Leaders need accurate feedback to identify their blind spots.

Denial is biggest challenge. To overcome, must be honest with self and not make up excuses. This has helped me accept criticism and take it seriously, even if it’s painful. We all have things we do wrong. Either you let them get in your way your whole life, or you fix them.

What would it mean if we were willing to be vulnerable and expose our full selves to the world by just being our authentic selves? No more false layers of protection. Liberating: I can be who I am. Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond. If I’ve got nothing to hide and admit my faults before you can call them out, what are you going to do to me?

How can we develop self-awareness and acceptance of ourselves? Best ways are having an introspective practice and getting honest feedback. We need to have daily practices that enable us to pause and focus on ourselves, take stock of our actions and pressures, and go deeper inside ourselves. There are several introspective practices that leaders find effective in enabling them to focus their attention and their energies.

Most powerful is meditation. Meditation has recently come of age as a mainstream practice. Meditation is the best thing I have ever done to calm myself and separate from the 24/7 connected world. By centering into myself, I am able to focus my attention on what’s really important, and develop an inner sense of well-being. Able to gain clarity about important issues. My most creative ideas come from meditating. Enabled me to build resilience to deal with difficult times. There are many other introspective practices that leaders find effective: saying a centering prayer, taking a long walk, or having deep discussions with a loved one. The important thing is to have an introspective practice you do daily.

One of the most important skills leaders need to develop is the ability to see themselves as others see them. Honest feedback is often hard to get. People tell leaders what they want to hear. Seek out feedback from peers and subordinates. Anonymous, 360-degree feedback. The best thing you can get in this world is honest feedback from someone who cares about your success and well-being. Some are more self-aware than others, but few of us see the world as it sees us. I go back and apologize, saying my reaction was against me not you. My defensiveness is a mechanism to cope with unpleasant personal news. I assure you I hold you in higher regard because you shared that with me.

Johari Window designed in 1955 is a means of gaining self-awareness and becoming more open. Nearly all of us have traits, habits, and tendencies that others see in us but we are unable to see in ourselves. Only through self-compassion can we have genuine empathy for others and difficulties they have faced. Respecting others’ experiences requires you to love yourself unconditionally first.

Dealing with weaknesses and shadow sides so you can accept the things you like least about yourself. Experiences you have hidden for years. Once armed with a high level of self-awareness and self-acceptance, it’s much easier to regulate your emotions and behavior. Mindfulness - ability to focus your attention on your thoughts, emotions, feelings in the present moment.

What are your vulnerabilities, blind spots, shadow sides? To what extent do you use defensive armor as a shield to protect yourself from exposing vulnerabilities with others?
When you face displeasing situations or receive critical feedback from others, how well are you able to take in the feedback and respond in a constructive manner without acting defensively?
      4.   How comfortable are you with who you are right now?

V. Values

It’s important to identify values and principles that guide your leadership. Derived from beliefs and convictions. It is relatively easy to be true to your values when things are going well. In defining your values, you must decide what is most important in your life. Leadership principles are values translated into practice. For example, a value, such as concern for others, might translate into a leadership principle such as “create a work environment where people are respected for their contributions, provided job security, and allowed to fulfill their potential. Develop a clear sense of values, principles, ethical boundaries before they get into crises are better prepared to keep their bearings and navigate through difficult decisions.

When you’re forced to make tradeoffs between your values under difficult circumstances, you learn what is most important in your life. When the company went through a rapid growth phase in the 1990s, the leading-by-values philosophy was an invaluable tool for introducing new employees to the company’s culture.

List the values that are important to your life and leadership. After you have done so, go back and rank them in order of their importance.
List leadership principles you use in leading others. Then go back and rank them depending on which are most important to you.

VI. Sweet Spot

We will explore how to find your sweet spot - intersection of your motivations and greatest strengths. Feel inspired to do great things and confident that you can accomplish them. To deliver high performance, leaders need to sustain high levels of motivation. 2 types of motivations - extrinsic, intrinsic. Extrinsic motivations such as getting good grades, winning athletic competitions, or making money, are measured by the external world. Being driven entirely by extrinsic motivations is a dangerous trap that can lead you astray from your true north. Intrinsic motivations are derived from your deepest inner desires, not the world’s adulation. Include personal growth, helping others, taking on social causes, creating great products or services, and making a difference in the world through your efforts.



Extrinsic Motivations
Intrinsic Motivations
Monetary compensation
Having power
Having a title
Public recognition
Social status
Winning over others

Personal growth
Satisfaction of doing a good job
Helping others develop
Finding meaning from efforts
Being true to one’s beliefs
Making a difference in the world

The only way to avoid getting caught up in materialism is to understand where you find happiness and fulfillment.

The term “sweet spot” describes your motivated capabilities when your motivations and strengths align. Find out what you are good at and what you like to do. You will be most effective as a leader when you find opportunities that highly motivate you and use your greatest capabilities. You must understand your deepest motivations and be honest with yourself about your capabilities. If your values aren’t consistent with the people you’re working with, you should not be there. We are the mosaic of all our experiences.

At some point most leaders recognize they need to do what they love rather than achieving external acclaim. Seek esteem of peers, promotions in title, and financial rewards that come with success. Danger comes when leaders become so enamored with these external symbols that they can never get enough. Truly great accomplishments come only from exploiting strengths. Many of the most extraordinary people in history were tremendously flawed individuals.

 I always put the customer on top of a stool whose four corners are value, customer service, technology, and best price. You need to know what motivates you and have a realistic understanding of your strengths and weaknesses so that you can put your strongest capabilities to work. When you do so, you will discover the sweet spot of your motivated capabilities.

What are your extrinsic motivations? Which might become too dominant for you?
What are your intrinsic motivations? How do you ensure you are giving them priority?
      4.   What are your greatest capabilities? How does your work and life use them?
      5.   List your motivated capabilities, areas where you are both highly motivated and very capable.
      6.   Envision future situations where you can apply your motivated capabilities in your sweet spot.



VII. Support Team

In challenging times, you need a solid network of trusted relationships with people who are available to counsel and care for you. Your support team has faith in you and understands your True North. Most leaders are afraid to be vulnerable, they think I’m supposed to be strong and have all the answers. Paradoxically, his vulnerability, honesty and clarity inspired others to stay the course.

Without confidants to provide perspective in crisis, it’s very easy to lose your way. Authentic leaders build close relationships with people who will counsel them in times of uncertainty, be there in times of difficulty, and celebrate with them in times of success. If you don’t reveal your vulnerabilities to these trusted people, giving voice to your uncertainties and acknowledging your fears as Tad Piper did, leadership becomes a very lonely place.

Many authentic leaders have mentors who changed their lives by helping them develop the skills to become better leaders and the confidence to lead authentically. Importance of 2-way relationship with mentors. Lasting relationships must flow both ways. Best mentoring interactions spark mutual learning, exploration of similar values, and shared enjoyment.

Many people are afraid to approach potential mentors because they do not want to impose on others. They fail to realize how much they can offer to their mentors. Warren Bennis tells young leaders they have to recruit great mentors. People are drawn to him because he unleashes the leadership potential of those whom he touches. By being vulnerable and making subordinates his advisers, Campbell gave Komisar, Dubinsky, and Chizen the confidence and license to be authentic.

True north groups: peer groups that meet regularly to talk about important issues in their lives.  Safe environment to open up, share your vulnerabilities and challenges, and engage in intimate discussions. True north groups as a guide. Have some group that will tell you the truth and to whom you can tell the truth. The key to success is what we call “honest conversations” saying what you really believe without fear of judgment, criticism, or reprisal. There are multiple forms of support groups. Couples group with 3 other pairs of friends 20 years ago.

VIII. Integrated Life

There is never enough time to do everything you want to do. Nor will you be able to achieve a perfect balance between all aspects of your life. Inevitably you will have to make tradeoffs. Authentic leaders must give families priority and take care of themselves personally in terms of health, recreation, spirituality, introspection. To lead an integrated life, you need to bring together the major elements of your personal life and professional life, including work, family, community and friends so that you can be the same person in each environment.

I remember watching the inefficiency that kicked in then people stressed out. Donahoe learned that the more he integrated his life and embraced his humanity, the more effective he became as a leader. By showing his team and clients his vulnerabilities, he discovered his teams performed better and his client relationships strengthened.

To find that delicate balance, it’s essential to set clear boundaries between work and home life. If you do so, you will be pleasantly surprised about where life will lead you. Marriage is not a static state. To have a successful longterm marriage, you and your spouse have to work at it continuously, talking openly about your differences, fears and vulnerabilities. Leaders who work equally hard during 50-60 hours but balance their work with family needs. Integrated leaders develop healthier orgs. By appropriately delegating their work, they make more thoughtful decisions and lead more effectively. Ultimately our lives are an expression of the choices we make.

I have 4 buckets representing the important areas of my life. One is my career, the 2nd is my family, the 3rd is my community and personal friendships, and 4th is the personal activities I enjoy. There are many mundane things in your life you have to let go of and not feel guilty about.

Sheryl Sandberg integrates the buckets of her life through a fundamental belief that success lies in the identification of real priorities at work and at home and an acceptance that no one can possibly do it all. I focused on what really mattered and became more efficient, only attending meetings that were truly necessary. I was determined to maximize my output while away from home.

To restore themselves and keep their sense of perspective, leaders may have a special place they can go with their families on weekends and vacations. It’s not important what you do, as long as you establish routines to relieve your stress and think clearly about life, work, and personal issues. It’s critical not to abandon these routines when you’re facing an especially busy period, because that is when you need your stress reduction techniques most of all.

Have you clearly defined how you measure your success in life? If not, you are at risk of defaulting to metrics such as money, fame and power, or letting others measure success for you. Real integrity results from merging all aspects of your life so that you are true to yourself in all settings.

4. What is the most difficult choice/tradeoff between various aspects of your life that you have made in the past? What would you do differently in the future?
5. How do you measure success in your life? What is your personal scorecard? What longterm achievements would you like to realize? What will bring you the greatest amount of happiness?



Part 3: Your True North Meets The World

By shifting your focus from yourself to serving others, you make the transformation from I to We.

IX. I to We

We are ready to tackle the greatest challenge of your journey: the transformation from I to We. Difficult for emerging leaders to recognize that leadership is not about them and their ability to attract followers but is about serving others to bring out the best in them. We leaders are servant leaders. Greenleaf described his views on the leader in his 1970 essay “The Servant as Leader”. A servant-leader focuses primarily on the growth and wellbeing of people and communities to which they belong. The servant-leader shares power, puts the needs of others first, and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible.

When you become a leader, your challenge is to inspire others, develop them, and create change through them. If you want to be a leader, you’ve got to flip that switch and understand that it’s about serving the folks on your team. This is a very simple concept, but one many people overlook. The sooner people realize it, the faster they will become leaders.


I Leaders
We Leaders
Leaders attain power and position
Self-interest drives decision making
I can do it on my own
Ask for compliance with rules
Arrogant
Leaders direct others
Focus on near-term results
Leaders get credit

Leaders serve others
Purpose drives decision making
Empower: work together to fulfill mission
Seek alignment through values
Humble
Leaders coach and mentor others
Focus on serving customers and employees
Inspire and uplift
Empower people to lead
Team gets the credit

Making the transformation from I to We requires introspection and cognitive regraming.
Does my life matter? To whom?
What’s the purpose of my life and my leadership?
Will I leave a legacy behind?
Life’s purpose is to accumulate possessions, material wealth, fame or power over others. Life is about serving something/someone greater than ourselves -- a worthy cause, an org important to you, family, or friend in need.

X. Purpose

You must choose your purpose carefully because your passion for that purpose is what draws people to you as a leader. If you aren’t clear about your purpose, why would others want to follow you? For your org, purpose is the motivating force that binds people together to drive the organization toward common goals.

Understanding your purpose is not as easy as it sounds. You can’t do so in the abstract; discerning it takes a combination of introspection and real-world experiences before you can determine where you want to devote your energies. Your leadership purpose doesn’t become meaningful until you apply it to the challenges you encounter in the real world by bringing people together around a common purpose.

Responsibility is to bring people together to pursue a shared purpose. Gaining alignment around a purpose is the greatest challenge leaders face. PepsiCo CEO has a clear vision of what makes up a good company. She cited 4 characteristics: 1. Returns value to shareholders; 2. Nourishes people/societies; 3. Minimizes environmental impact; 4. Cherishes its employees.

Employees don’t want to park their persona at the door. They want to work for a company where they can bring their whole selves to work -- a company that cares. For many of use, how and where we apply our purpose evolves throughout our lifetime. Yet a constant source of our purpose -- our true north -- stays the same as we navigate life’s changes.

XI. Empowerment

Hierarchical approach rarely works with today’s employees, especially the younger generation of millenials who are highly resistant to being directed by their bosses. Instead, they seek leaders who inspire them and give them the freedom to decide how they will achieve results.

Collective power of an empowered team far exceeds that of any single individual, and they rally teams around a common cause. The capacity to develop close, enduring relationships is one mark of empowering leaders. Unfortunately, many leaders of major companies believe their job is to create strategy, org structure, and org processes. Then they delegate the work to be done, remaining aloof from the people doing the work. Detached style of leadership will not be successful in the 21st century. Today’s employees demand more personal relationships with their leaders before they will give themselves fully to their jobs. They insist on having access to their leaders, knowing that it is in the openness and depth of the relationship with the leader that trust and commitment are built.

Many leaders get so busy that they don’t take the time to be there for people. As a result, their teammates never get to know them personally. To bring out the best from teammates, authentic leaders must develop trusting relationships based on mutual respect. Here are some of the things empowering leaders do to gain the respect of their colleagues:
Treat others as equals
Listen actively
Learn from people
Share life stories
Align around the mission
Active listening is one of the most important abilities of empowering leaders, because people sense such individuals are genuinely interested in them and not just trying to get something from them. We feel respected when others believe they can learn from us or ask for our advice. I have taken his advice into every class I have taught, telling MBA students and execs I feel certain I will learn a lot more from you than you do from me.

The most empowering condition of all is when the entire organization aligns with its mission, and people’s passions and purpose synchronize with each other. It’s not easy to get to this position. It’s worth whatever effort it takes to create an aligned environment, including removal of those who don’t support the mission. If org leaders can demonstrate how employees can fulfill their purpose while achieving the org’s mission, then alignment can occur.

It starts with how the leaders on top behave every day. They cannot preach empowerment and then behave in a hierarchical manner to get near-term results, or they lose credibility with their colleagues. CEO of Merck, Roy Vagelos ate regularly in the company cafeteria where he asked people about their work and the challenges they were facing. He took notes about the conversations and then thought about the specific problems for a few days before calling employees back with his ideas.

Multiple surveys by Gallup have shown that only 30% of employees are engaged with their work. That’s a disaster and tragic loss of human potential. By giving others latitude to lead with in the org’s broad purpose, they are able to delegate more leadership responsibilities while expanding the impact of their leadership to more people.

Empowerment must be accompanied by a high degree of accountability to deliver on your commitments. I was confronted by a senior exec saying it was not very empowering for me to challenge her results. When you talk about empowerment, you really mean empowerment with accountability. Successful leaders are closed-loop mgrs who follow up regularly with their team to ensure they are getting results and provide assistance as needed.

Brings his team together to gain agreement on goals/objectives yet is rigorous in following up to get candid reports on progress. Empowered leaders must be wholly accountable for their actions and transparent about their results, or the results are anarchy and politics, both of which lead to poor performance.

He used a green/yellow/red color coding system to assess the status of key projects. He changed the culture by getting each leader immersed in the details of the business and working like a team to improve performance. He had a unique ability to combine genuine caring for his people with real accountability for their results. His brand of tough love involved both toughness and caring: He was tough enough to transform Ford’s exec suite and caring enough to empower senior leaders and rally Ford’s employees around a new vision for global competitiveness.

Style of an authentic leader must come from an authentic place. That can happen only when you have a high level of self awareness, are clear about your values, and understand your leadership purpose. Your style should be the outward manifestation of your authentic leadership. In thinking about your leadership style, ask yourself these questions:
Is your leadership style consistent with your leadership principles and values?
How do you adapt your style to the circumstances facing you?
Are you concerned whether your authentic style will be acceptable in your org?
Do you worry that you may have to modify your style to get ahead?

Leadership styles:
Directive: Demand compliance/obedience with rules
Engaged: Mobilize people around shared purpose and values
Coaching: Develop people for leadership roles
Consensus: Build agreement through participation
Affiliative: Create emotional bonds and harmony
Expert: Expect competence and self-direction

You should adapt your leadership style to the capabilities of your teammates and their readiness to accept greater responsibility. In leading, it is important to understand the situation in which you are operating, as well as the performance imperative, and have the flexibility to maximize your effectiveness in that situation. When I go into my submarine mode, I go very deep into a problem and think I can solve it myself. That’s when I’m at risk of ignoring advice of experts and closing down debate. Moving nimbly in and out at different altitudes is crucial to leadership success, particularly in times of rapid growth and uncertainty.

XII. Global Leadership

In global roles, you will be asked to demonstrate geopolitical savvy, reinvent business models for emerging markets, build diverse teams, and redesign org models. Thriving in this complex environment requires qualities above and beyond those of authentic leaders. To help you prepare for global leadership, we introduce the concept of global intelligence, or GQ, and explore how to develop the traits of GQ leadership.

To transform Unilever’s culture, Polman created the Compass, his internal set of mission, values, and strategy statements that emphasize growth and winning in the market. If 70% of our business will be in emerging markets, ultimately 70% of our leaders must come from these markets. Visionary program for developing its global leaders -- Unilever Leadership Development Program (ULDP). Today’s world is far more uncertain than it was in the past, largely because of the rise of emerging markets with greater instability, speed of info tech, and interdependency of nations. Companies need a clear understanding of the geopolitical context of their business and have a keen awareness of how geopolitical events can affect it.

Americans rarely understand their own cultural biases, and just assume their ways are superior if only others understood. Companies are finding that imposing norms and marketing programs from headquarters does not work in emerging markets. To maximize growth in emerging markets, companies are recognizing they require much greater diversity in their decision-making ranks.

GQ consists of 7 elements: adaptability, awareness, curiosity, empathy, alignment, collaboration, integration. When leaders are placed in emerging market situations, the complexity increases exponentially because the differences in language, culture, customer preferences, negotiating tactics, business practices, laws, and ethical standards are so great.

Foresee changes coming in the years ahead. Must be able to adapt quickly to rapidly changing global context by shifting resources to opportunity areas and developing contingency plans to cope with adverse geopolitical situations. This is particularly true in emerging markets, where frequent changes in govt, currency movements, financial crises, ethnic conflicts, wars, and terrorism may literally change the business climate overnight.

Global leaders must have deep curiosity about cultures they encounter. This includes personal passion for diverse experiences and insatiable desire to learn from other cultures. Empathy builds rapport and bonding and creates lasting relationships. Achieving alignment is far more difficult in a global context because the business practices/ethics in emerging markets often differ so dramatically from those of developed countries. One of the best ways for aspiring leaders to increase their GQ is to live in an emerging country. Physically living in different countries is critically important for globalization of leaders.

Afterword: Stakeholders in Society

Alibaba’s 6 values: consumer first, teamwork, embrace change, integrity, passion, commitment. Short-term traders have had an insidious effect on capitalism. Focused on driving short-term gains rather than investing in companies for long-term returns. Frenzy to maximize short-term shareholder value. By forcing companies to cut research and other long-term investments, their pressure can destroy the economic value and future viability of firms.

What I required is that corporate and govt leaders work together to restore capitalism to its original purpose of serving society through its mission to serve all its stakeholders. You cannot sustain long-term stakeholder value unless you create sustainable value for customers, while assuring fairness to all stakeholders: customers, employees, investors, vendor partners, governments, and society. 4 guiding principles he calls “compassionate capitalism”. 1. The only way to remove poverty is to create new jobs and more wealth. 2. Only a few people can lead the creation of these enterprises and create jobs/wealth. 3. These people need incentives to create wealth fairly. 4. Not the govt’s responsibility to create jobs/wealth - the govt’s task is to create an environment where a fair incentive system encourages people to create more jobs and more wealth. If you combine the spirit of capitalism with fairness, decency, transparency, and honesty, the result is compassionate capitalism.

Think of the impact that global companies and local enterprises, both for profit and nonprofit, could have on addressing the world’s most pressing problems: global health, food/water supplies, population control, energy/environment, job creation, wealth distribution, global peace.
