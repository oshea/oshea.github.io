The four OKR purposes
1 Focus and commit to priorities
High performance organizations home in on work that’s important and are equally clear on what doesn’t matter.  OKRs impel leaders to make hard choices.  They’re a precision communication tool for departments, teams, and individual contributors.  By dispelling confusion, OKRs give us the focus we needed to win.

2 Align and connect for teamwork
With OKR transparency, everyone’s goals… are openly shared.  Individuals link their objectives to the company’s game plan, identify cross-dependencies, and coordinate with other teams.  By connecting each contributor to the organization’s success, top-down alignment brings meaning to work. By deepening people’s sense of ownership, bottom-up OKRs foster engagement and innovations.

3 Track for accountability
OKRs are driven by data.  They are animated by periodic check-ins, objective grading, and continuous reassessment--all in the spirit of no-judgment accountability.  An endangered key result triggers action to get it back on track, or to revise or replace it if warranted.

4 Stretch for amazing
OKRs motivate us to excel by doing more than we’d thought possible.  By testing our limits and affording the freedom to fail, they release our most creative, ambitious selves.

Andy Grove’s Basic OKR Hygiene
Less is more.
A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say ‘yes’ to and what we say ‘no’ to.  Limit to 3-5 OKRs per cycle at each level to force choosing what matters most.

Set goals from the bottom up.
To promote engagement, teams and individuals should be encourage to create roughly half of their own OKRs, in consultation with managers.

No dictating.
OKRs are a cooperative social contract to establish priorities and define how progress will be measured.

Stay flexible.
If the climate has changed and the objective no longer seems practical or relevant as written, it can be modified or discarded mid-cycle.

Dare to fail.
Output will tend to be greater when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond their immediate grasp.

A tool not a weapon.
The OKR system is meant to pace a person -- to put a stopwatch in her own hand so she can gauge her own performance.  It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review.

Be patient, be resolute.
Every process requires trial and error.


P53
Pairing key results
The more ambitious the OKR, the greater the risk of overlooking a vital criterion.  To safeguard quality while pushing for quantitative delivers, one solution is to pair key results (quantity and quality).

P56
Less is more
The one thing an OKR system should provide par excellence  is focus.  This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small… Each time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to something else. This, of course, is an inevitable, inescapable consequence of allocating any finite resource.  People who plan have to have the guts, honesty, and discipline to drop projects as well as to initiate them, to shake their heads “no” as well as to smile “yes”... We must realize--and act on the realization--that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing.

Above all, top-line objectives must be significant.  OKRs are neither a catchall wish list nor the sum of a team’s mundane tasks.  They’re a set of stringently curated goals that merit special attention and will move people forward in the here and now.  They link to the larger purpose we’re expected to deliver around.  “The art of management”, Grove wrote, “lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them.”  Or as Larry Page would say, winning organizations need to “put more wood behind fewer arrows.”
