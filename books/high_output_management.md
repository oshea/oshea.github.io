High Output Management by Andrew S. Grove

Introduction
Another group should also be included among middle managers -- people who may not supervise anyone directly but who even without strict organizational authority affect and influence the work of others. These know-how managers are sources of knowledge, skills and understanding to people around them in an organization.

A higher tolerance for disorder

The idea that you should run your managerial processes like a well-oiled factory -- is every bit as much the ideal now as it was when I wrote this book.

Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos.

The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence.

What specifically should they be doing during the day when a virtually limitless number of possible tasks calls for their attention?

Managerial leverage, what managers do to increase the output of their teams. High managerial productivity, I argue, depends largely on choosing to perform tasks that possess high leverage.

Sports analogy, task-relevant feedback. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event. Second, a responsive company should have fewer levels of managers.

One-on-one meeting between a supervisor and a subordinate. Its main purposes are mutual education and the exchange of information. By talking about specific problems and situations. One-on-ones take time, both in preparing for them and actually holding them

As a general rule, you have to accept that no matter where you work, you are not an employee -- you are in a business with one employee: yourself.  You are in competition with millions of similar businesses. There are millions of others all over the world, picking up the pace, capable of doing the same work that you can do and perhaps more eager to do it. So if you want to work and continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage.

The key task is to manage your career so that you do not become a casualty.
Are you adding real value or merely passing information along? How do you add more value? By continually looking for ways to make things truly better in your department. You are a manager. The central thought of my book is that the output of a manager is the output of his organization.
Are you plugged into what’s happening around you?
Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies, and I mean personally trying them, not just reading about them?
Applying the methods of production, exercising managerial leverage, and eliciting an athlete’s desire for peak performance can help nearly everyone

Foreword

A manager’s output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.
When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. All you can do to improve the output of an employee is motivate and train.

It turns out that the one-on-one is not only a fundamental element in the manager/employee relationship, but perhaps the best source for organizational knowledge that a manager can get.

Is it better to be a hands-on or hands-off manager? It depends. If the employee is immature in the task, then hands-on training is essential. If the employee is more mature, then a delegate approach is warranted.

Motivation and training. If you are not training, then you are basically neglecting half the job.

CEOs always act on leading indicators of good news, but only act on lagging indicators of bad news.  

The Peter Principle is a concept in management theory in which the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate’s performance in their current role, rather than on abilities related to the intended role. Thus, “managers rise to the level of their incompetence.”

The Breakfast Factory

Basic requirements of production. These are to build and deliver products in response to the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery time, at an acceptable quality level, and at the lowest possible cost.

Limiting step - the step in the flow that will determine the overall shape of our operation.
Total throughput time - length of the entire process.
Key idea is that we construct our production flow by starting with the longest (or most difficult, or most sensitive, or most expensive) step and work our way back. The idea of a limiting step has very broad applicability.
Process manufacturing, an activity that physically or chemically changes material just as boiling changes an egg; assembly, in which components are put together to constitute a new entity just as the egg, toast and coffee make breakfast; and test, which subjects the components or the total to an examination of its characteristics.

Breakfast operation assumed infinite capacity. Account for the queue. Turn personnel into specialists, that creates an immense amount of overhead.

Equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory can be traded off against each other and then balanced against delivery time. Your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources -- the key to optimizing all types of productive work. To find that right answer, you must develop a clear understanding of the trade-offs between the various factors --manpower, capacity, and inventory, and you must reduce the understanding to a quantifiable set of relationships.

Continuous operation at the expense of flexibility. You should choose in-process tests over those that destroy product. Incoming or receiving inspection, raw material inventory, opportunity at risk: what would it cost if you had to shut your egg machine down for a day? Material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process. Detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible.

II. Managing the Breakfast Factory

To run your operation well, you will need a set of good indicators, or measurements. You have to focus each indicator on a specific operational goal. Correct a potential problem before it becomes a real one over the course of the day. Indicators tend to direct your attention toward what they are monitoring. You should guard against overreacting. Any measurement is better than none. But a genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved.

Cutting some windows in our box so that we can see some of what goes on within it. Leading indicators give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like. You must believe in their validity. Unless you are prepared to act on what your leading indicators are telling you, all you will get from monitoring them is anxiety. Should be credible so you will act whenever they flash warning signals. Linearity indicator, trend indicators, stagger chart (forecasting economic trends, best means of getting a feel for future business trends)

Build the forecast (contemplation of future orders). Ask both the manufacturing and sales departments to prepare a forecast, so that people are responsible for performing against their own predictions. Lowest-value stage. All production flows must possess inspection points. In-process inspections, outgoing quality inspections. There is a gate-like inspection and a monitoring step. Variable inspections.

Increase productivity - go faster. Getting more activities per employee-hour. Change the nature of the work performed: what we do. Work smarter, not harder. Automation, work simplification.

Management is a Team Game
III. Managerial Leverage

A manager’s output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.

Output of a manager is the result achieved by a group either under her supervision or under her influence. Engaging in an array of activities in order to affect output. But output and activity are by no means the same thing.

A Day from My Life: decision-gathering, information-gathering, nudges, information-giving, role model

A manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift his energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of his organization. He should move to the point where his leverage will be the greatest. Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communication information. Writing the report is important; reading it often is not.

Using programmed visits meant to accomplish formal tasks, but which also sets the stage for ad-hoc mini-transactions. Manager not only gathers information but is also a source of it. Communicate objects, priorities, and preferences as they bear on the way certain tasks are approached. This is extremely important because only if the manager imparts these will his subordinates know how to make decisions acceptable to the manager. Transmitting objectives and preferred approaches constitutes a key to successful delegation.

The third major kind of managerial activity, of course, is decision-making. Make a decision, participate in the making of many, many others, and we do that in a variety of ways. Provide factual input or just offer opinions, debate pros and cons of alternatives and thereby force a better decision to emerge, we review decisions made or about to be made by others, encourage or discourage them, ratify or veto them. How well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager’s life. Other activities -- conveying information, making decisions, and being a role model for your subordinates -- are all governed by the base of information that you, the manager, have about the tasks, the issues, the needs, and the problems facing your organization. In short, information gathering is the basis of all other managerial work, which is why I choose to spend so much of my day doing it.

You often do things at the office designed to influence events slightly, suggesting that a decision be made in a certain way, or sending a note or memo that shows how you see a particular situation, or making a comment during an oral presentation. You’re doing something stronger than merely conveying information. Let’s call it “nudging” because through it you nudge an individual or a meeting in the direction you would like. This is an immensely important managerial activity. While we move about, doing what we regard as our jobs, we are role models for people in our organization -- our subordinates, peers and even our supervisors. Values and behavioral norms are simply not transmitted easily by talk or memo, but are conveyed very effectively by doing and doing visibly.

A great deal of a manager’s work has to do with allocating resources: manpower, money, and capital. But the single most important resource that we allocate from one day to the next is our own time. How you handle your own time is, in my view, the single most important aspect of being a role model and leader. But you must choose the most effective medium for what you want to accomplish, and that is the one that vies you the greatest leverage. Leverage is the measure of the output generated by any given managerial activity. Accordingly, managerial output can be linked to managerial activity by the equation: Managerial Output = Output of organization = L1xA1+L2xA2+ . . .
For every activity a manager performs -- A1, A2 and so on -- the output of the organization should increase. Extent to which output is thereby increased is determined by the leverage of that activity -- L1, L2 and so on.

Managerial productivity can be increased in three ways:
Increasing the rate with which a manager performs his activities, speeding up his work.
Increasing the leverage associated with the various managerial activities.
Shifting the mix of a manager’s activities from those with lower to those with higher leverage.
High-leverage activities: when many people are affected by one manager. When a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well-focused set of words or actions. When a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information. Great leverage depends on when it is performed. To maximize leverage of his activities, a manager must keep timeliness, which is often critical, firmly in mind.

 Leverage can also be negative, reduce the output of an organization. Waffling, when a manager puts off a decision that will affect the work of other people. In effect, the lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization. Managerial meddling is also an example of negative leverage. This occurs when a supervisor uses his superior knowledge and experience of a subordinate’s responsibilities to assume command of a situation rather than letting the subordinate work things through himself. The third kind of managerial activity with high leverage is exercised by a person with unique skills and knowledge. The art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage weill beyond the others and concentrate on them.

Because managerial time has a hierarchy of values, delegation is an essential aspect of management. Must share a common information base and a common set of operational ideas or notions on how to go about solving problems, a requirement that is frequently not met. Principle: delegation without follow-through is abdication. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result. Monitoring the results of delegation resembles the monitoring used in quality assurance. Monitor at the lowest-added-value stage of the process. Review rough drafts of reports that you have delegated. To check into all the details of a delegated task would be like quality assurance testing 100 percent of what manufacturing turned out.

Most obvious way to increase managerial output is to increase the rate or speed. Most common approach: time-management techniques. First we must identify our limiting step. In short, if we determine what is immovable and manipulate the more yielding activities around it, we can work more efficiently. A second production principle we can apply to managerial work is batching similar tasks. Setup time has many parallels in managerial work, to maximize the use of the mental setup time needed for the task.

To gain better control of his time, the manager should use his calendar as a “production” planning tool, taking a firm initiative to schedule work that is not time-critical between those “limiting steps” in the day. Your calendar as a production planning tool, accept responsibility for two things:
Move toward active use of your calendar, taking initiative to fill holes between time-critical events with non-time-critical though necessary activities.
You should say no at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle.
Allow slack -- a bit of looseness in your scheduling. A manager should carry a raw material inventory in terms of projects. Discretionary projects, the kind the manager can work on to increase his group’s productivity over the long term. Without such an inventory of projects, a manager will most probably use his free time meddling in his subordinates’ work. This means that even as we try to standardize what we do, we should continue to think critically about what we do and the approaches we use.

An important component of managerial leverage is the number of subordinates a manager has. A manager should have 6 to 8 subordinates, about a half day per week to each.

Interruptions -- The Plague of Managerial Work
Strive toward regularity. Recognizing you’ve got a time bomb on your hands means you can address a problem when you want to, not after the bomb has gone off. Most common problem cited was uncontrolled interruptions. Common source, most frequently coming from subordinates and from people outside the managers’ immediate organization but whose work the managers influenced. Principle of batching -- many interruptions that come from your subordinates can be accumulated and handled not randomly, but at staff and one-on-one meetings. Batch questions and problems for scheduled times. Manager should try to force his frequent interrupters to make an active decision about whether an issue can wait. The point is to impose a pattern on the way a manager copes with problems.

IV. Meetings -- The Medium of Managerial Work

A meeting is nothing less than the medium through which managerial work is performed. Should not be fighting their very existence, but rather using the time spent in them as efficiently as possible. Process-oriented meeting, knowledge is shared and information is exchanged. Purpose of the second kind of meeting is to solve a specific problem. Mission oriented - produce a decision. Infuse it with regularity. Know how the meeting is run, what kinds of substantive matters are discussed, and what is to be accomplished. Allow a manager to “batch” transactions. 3 kinds of process-oriented meetings: one-on-one, staff meeting, and operation review.

1-on-1: main purpose is mutual teaching and exchange of information, talking about specific problems and situations, supervisor teaches the subordinate his skills and know-how, suggests ways to approach things. Provides supervisor with detailed information about what he is doing and what he is concerned about. How often - job or task relevant maturity of each of your subordinates. You should have one-on-ones frequently (for example, once a week) with a subordinate who is inexperienced and less frequently with an experienced veteran. It should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him. Somebody needs to prepare for the meeting, should be asked to prepare an outline. Very important because it forces him to think through in advance all of the issues and points he plans to raise. What should be covered? Performance figures, anything important since last meeting, potential problems. By applying Grove’s Principle of Didactic Management, “Ask one more question!” When the supervisor thinks the subordinate has said all he wants about a subject, ask another question. Both supervisor and subordinate should have a copy of the outline and both should take notes on it. Using a hold file - accumulate important but not altogether urgent issues for discussion.

Peer interaction -- especially decision-making by a group of peers -- is not easy. Yet it is key to good management. By learning how this happens in staff meetings, where a group of peers get to know each other, and where the presence of a common supervisor helps peer interaction to develop, managers will be prepared to be members of other working bodies based on peer groups. Much better understanding of an issue not familiar with by listening to 2 people with opposing views discuss it. Should be mostly controlled, with an agenda. Chance to prepare thoughts for the meeting. Include an “open session” - bring up anything they want. Supervisor should never use staff meetings to pontificate, which is the surest way to undermine free discussion and hence the meeting’s basic purpose

Operation Reviews
Managers describe work to other managers who are not their immediate supervisors, and peers in other parts of the company. Teaching and learning going on between employees several organizational levels apart.

Key to success is what the chairman does. No one has that title but one person usually has more at stake in the outcome of the meeting than others. Calls the meeting, most of what he contributes should occur before it begins. Chairman must have a clear understanding of the meeting’s objective -- what needs to happen and what decision has to be made. So before calling a meeting, as yourself: What am I trying to accomplish? Then ask, is a meeting necessary? Desirable? Justifiable? Once the meeting is over, chairman must nail down exactly what happened by sending out minutes that summarize the discussion that occurred, decision made, and actions to be taken.

V. Decisions, Decisions

If Intel used people holding old-fashioned position power to make all its decisions, decisions would be made by people unfamiliar with the technology of the day. Ideal model of decision making in a know-how business. 1st stage: free discussion, all points of view and aspects of issue openly welcomed and debated. Next stage is reaching a clear decision. Particular pains should be taken to frame the terms of the decision with utter clarity. Everyone involved must give the decision reached by the group full support. Committing to support the decisions and moves of the business is honestly present. Important feature of the model is that any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. Anybody who makes a business decision also possesses emotions such as pride, ambition, fear, and insecurity.

Peers tend to look for a more senior manager, even if he is not the most competent or knowledgeable person involved, to take over and shape a meeting. Most people are afraid to stick their necks out. Overcome the peer-group syndrome if each member has self-confidence. Fear of sounding dumb paralyzes both knowledge and position power possessors. Fear of being overruled which might mean embarrassment.

Sometimes no amount of discussion will produce a consensus. Senior person must make decision himself, having had the full benefit of free discussion with all points of view, facts, opinions, and judgements. Destructive for him to wield that authority any earlier.  If you feel that you have already heard everything, that all sides of the issue have been raised, time to push for a consensus, and failing that, to step in and make a decision. Manager’s key tasks is to settle six important questions in advance:
What decision needs to be made?
When?
Who will decide?
Who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision?
Who will ratify or veto the decision?
Who will need to be informed?

VI. Planning: Today’s Actions for Tomorrow’s Output


Step 1: Environmental Demand
Once you have established what constitutes your environment, you need to examine it in two time frames - now and sometime in the future, e.g. 1 year. Difference analysis. How you react to this difference is the key outcome of the planning process.
Step 2: Present Status
Step 3: What To Do To Close The Gap
What do you need to do to close the gap? What can you do? Consider each question separately and then decide. Strategy at one managerial level is the tactical concern of the next higher level.

Planning produced tasks that had to be performed now in order to affect future events. What do I have to do today to solve -- or better, avoid -- tomorrow’s problem? Who should be involved in the planning process? The operating management of the organization. Planners cannot be apart from those implementing the plan. By saying “yes” to projects, course of action, whatever, you are implicitly saying no to something else. You forfeit your chance to commit to something else.

MBO system:
Where do I want to go?
How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there?

VII. The Breakfast Factory Goes National

We definitely want to impose national quality control standards.

VIII. Hybrid Organizations

Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization. Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage. Even conveying needs and demands often becomes very difficult -- a business unit has to go through a number of management layers to influence decision-making in a functional group. There is simply no alternative to the hybrid organizational structure. Hybrid orgs are inevitable.

Grove’s Law: All large orgs with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid org form.
Forming an executive committee that would not interfere with the legal (mission-oriented) work of the individual attorneys but would address the acquisition and allocation of common, shared resources. The most important task before such an org is the optimum and timely allocation of its resources and the efficient resolution of conflicts arising over that allocation. Allocation of shared resources and reconciliation of conflicting needs and desires of independent business units are theoretically the function of corporate mgmt. Practically however, the transaction load is far too heavy to be handled in one place. High-leverage task, 2 things are necessary. Accept inevitability of hybrid org, and develop/master the practice of managing a hybrid org. (Dual reporting)

IX. Dual Reporting

An unintended consequence of the moon shot was the development of a new organizational approach: matrix management. Core idea was that a project mgr, somebody outside any of the contractors involved, could wield as much influence on the work of units within a given company as could the company mgmt itself. Security personnel should report jointly to the corporate security mgr and to the local plant mgr. The 1st would specify how the job ought to be done, and the 2nd would monitor how it was being performed day by day. Manufacturing mgrs report to 2 supervisors: to this group and to their respective general mgrs. To make such a body work requires the voluntary surrender of individual decision-making to the group. You must go along with the decisions of your peers in most instances.

To make hybrid orgs work, you need a way to coordinate the mission-oriented units and the functional groups so that the resources of the latter are allocated and delivered to meet the needs of the former. Report to someone in both the functional and mission-oriented orgs, with type of supervision reflecting the varying needs of the two.

We have seen that all kinds of orgs evolve into a hybrid org form. They must also develop a system of dual reporting. Like it or not, the hybrid org is a fundamental phenomenon of org life. The more varied the nature of the problems we face and the more rapidly things change around us, the more we have to rely on such specially composed transitory teams to cope with matters. The techniques we have to master to make hybrid orgs work -- dual or multiple reporting and also decision-making by peer groups -- are both necessary if such transitory teams are to work. The key factor common to all is the use of cultural values as a mode of control, which we will consider next.

X. Modes of Control

Let’s look at the ways in which our actions can be controlled or influenced. Eventually you’ll make a decision based on one thing: your own self-interest. Our behavior in a work environment can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means: free market forces, contractual obligations, cultural values.

For much that changes hands in a work or business environment, value is hard to establish. Cultural values: surrendering to the group your ability to protect yourself. You must believe that you all share a common set of values, objectives and methods.

The Role of Mgmt
You don’t need mgmt to supervise free market forces. Contractual obligation - set and modify the rules, monitor adherence, evaluate/improve. Cultural values - develop/nurture the common set of values. How? Articulation, example.

Given a certain set of conditions, there is always a most appropriate mode of control. 2 variables: nature of person’s motivation, nature of work environment. Environment’s complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity (CUA factor). Apply model to work of new employee. What is his motivation? Based on self interest. So give him a clearly structured job with low CUA factor. If he does well, he will begin to feel more at home, worry less about himself, and start to care more about his team.

At any one time, 1 of the 3 modes of control may govern what we are doing. But from one day to the next, we find ourselves influenced by all 3.

The Players
XI. The Sports Analogy

Earlier I built a case summed up by the key sentence: A manager’s output is the output of the organization under his supervision or influence. Mgmt is a team activity. Everything we’ve considered so far is useless unless team members continually try to offer the best they can do. 2 reasons for not doing job: not capable (can’t do it) or not motivated (won’t do it).

The single most important task of a mgr is to elicit peak performance from his subordinates. 2 ways to tackle the issue: training and motivation. Motivation has to come from within. Create an environment in which motivated people can flourish. Maslow’s theory of motivation - closely tied to the idea of needs, which cause people to have drives, resulting in motivation. To create/maintain a high degree of motivation, keep some needs unsatisfied at all times. Set of needs lie in a hierarchy: self-actualization, esteem/recognition, social/affiliation, safety/security, physiological.

Self-actualization stems from a personal realization that “what I can be, I must be.” The need to achieve one’s utter personal best in a chosen field of endeavor. Drive to perform has no limit. Two inner forces can drive a person to use all of his capabilities. Competence-driven or achievement-driven. Both types spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities. Output will tend to be greater when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond his immediate grasp, even though trying means failure half the time. Such goal-setting is extremely important if what you want is peak performance from yourself and your subordinates. Moreover, if we want to cultivate achievement-driven motivation, we need to create an environment that values and emphasizes output.

Once there is enough money to bring a person up to a level he expects of himself, more money will not motivate. At the upper level of the need hierarchy, when one is self-actualized, money in itself is no longer a source of motivation but rather a measure of achievement. Very important responsibility of a mgr is to steer people away from irrelevant and meaningless rewards. Task-relevant feedback - performance review every subordinate should receive from his supervisor. You cannot stay in the self-actualized mode if you’re always worried about failure.

Our role as mgrs is first to train individuals, and second to bring them to the point where self-actualization motivates them. Why does a person who is not terribly interested in his work at the office stretch himself to the limit running a marathon? He is trying to beat other people at the stopwatch. Imagine how productive our country would become if mgrs could endow all work with the characteristics of competitive sports.

Best way to get that spirit in the workplace is to establish some rules of the game, ways for employees to measure themselves. Eliciting peak performance means going up against something or somebody. This is key to the manager’s approach and involvement: he has to see the work as it is seen by the people who do that work every day and then create indicators. The role of the mgr is the coach. First, an ideal coach takes no personal credit for the success of his team, and because of that his players trust him. Second, he is tough on his team. By being critical, he tries to get the best performance his team members can provide. Third, a good coach was likely a good player himself at one time. And having played the game well, he also understands it well.

XII. Task-Relevant Maturity

The inevitable conclusion is that high output is associated with particular combinations of certain managers and certain groups of workers. This also suggests that a given managerial approach is not equally effective under all conditions. Some researchers in this field argue that there is a fundamental variable that tells you what the best management style  is in a particular situation. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience.

What happened here should have been totally predictable, yet we were surprised: we confused the manager’s general competence and maturity with his task-relevant maturity. Regardless of what the TRM may be, the mgr should always monitor a subordinate’s work closely enough to avoid surprises. The presence or absence of monitoring, as we’ve said before, is the difference between a supervisor delegating a task and abdicating it.


Task-relevant maturity of subordinate
Characteristics of effective mgmt style
low
Structured; task-oriented; tell “what, when, how”
medium
Individual-oriented; emphasis on 2-way communication, support, mutual reasoning
high
Involvement by mgr minimal; establishing objectives and monitoring

Structure moves from being externally imposed to being internally given. The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external.

Once operational values are learned and TRM is high enough, the supervisor can delegate tasks to the sub, thus increasing his managerial leverage. We mgrs must learn to fight such prejudices and regard any mgmt mode not as either good or bad but rather as effective or not effective, given the TRM of our subordinates within a specific working environment.

Given such reviews is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback we as supervisors can provide. Makes the appraisal one of the manager’s highest-leverage activities. Extremely powerful mechanism. It is to improve the sub’s performance. Dedicated to 2 things: Skill level of sub. (What skills are missing, find ways to remedy that lack), Intensify the sub’s motivation in order to get him on a higher performance curve for the same skill level. If performance matters in your operation, performance reviews are absolutely necessary.

Assessing Performance
We can characterize performance by output measures and internal measures. We should know which 2 variables are being traded off against each other. A similar kind of tradeoff also has to be considered here: weighing long-term-oriented against short-term oriented performance. Time offset between activity and output. At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. Performance rating of a mgr cannot be higher than the one we would accord to his org!

Delivering the Assessment
There are 3 L’s when delivering a review: level, listen, and leave yourself out. Credibility and integrity of the entire system depend on your being totally frank. Listen with all your might to make sure your subordinate is receiving your message, and don’t stop delivering it until you are satisfied that he is.

Concentrating on the stars is a high-leverage activity; if they get better, the impact on group output is very great indeed. No matter how stellar a person’s performance level is, there is always room for improvement.

Is it a good idea to ask the sub to prepare some kind of a self-review before being reviewed by his supervisor? What about asking your sub to evaluate your performance as his supervisor? I think this might be a good idea.

XIV. Two Difficult Tasks

Emotionally charged tasks a mgr must perform: interviewing a potential employee, and trying to talk a valued employee out of quitting. Applicant should do 80% of talking, what he talks about should be your main concern. Interrupt/stop him, because if you don’t, you are wasting your only asset - interview time. You have to get as much info and insight as possible.
Best questions:
Describe some projects that were highly regarded by your mgmt.
Convince me why my company should hire you.
What are some problems you are encountering in your current position? How are you solving them?
What do you consider your most significant achievements?
Trying to get a feel for his set of operational values, those that would guide him on the job.

XV. Compensation as Task-Relevant Feedback

Money has significance at all levels of Maslow’s motivation hierarchy. As one moves up the need hierarchy, money begins to mean a measure of one’s worth in a competitive environment. Use money to deliver task-relevant feedback. For promotions consider the Peter Principle - when someone is good at his job, he is promoted, keeps getting promoted until he reaches his level of incompetence and stays there. Captures at least some of what happens in a merit-based promotion system.

 An achiever will alternate between “meets requirements” and “exceeds requirements” ratings throughout his career. We have no choice but to promote until a level of “incompetence” is reached. This way we drive our subs toward higher performance, and while they may perform at a “meets” level half the time, they will do that at an increasingly more challenging and difficult job level. We mgrs must be responsible and provide our subs with honest performance ratings and honest merit-based compensation. If we do, the eventual result will be performance values for its own sake throughout our org.

XVI. Why Training Is the Boss’s Job

For the already overscheduled mgr, the trickier issue may be who should do the training. I strongly believe the mgr should do it himself. Training is one of the highest-leverage activities a mgr can perform. Should be a process, not an event. What you teach must be closely tied to what you practice, and training needs to be a continuing process rather than a one-time event. Must be done by a person who represents a suitable role model. Don’t limit the scope of your list. Items should range from what seems simple to loftier and more general things like the objectives and value systems of your dept, plant and company.

Ask the people working for you what they feel they need. Regard the first time you teach the course as a throwaway, it won’t be great because no matter how hard you try you’ll have to go through one version that won’t be. Training is hard work.
