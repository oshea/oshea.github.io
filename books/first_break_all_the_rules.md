## What matters for a manager:

* Focus on employee strength and make best use of them.
    * Don't waste time trying to fix a weakness; it is what it is; find a way to work around it.
    * Finding the right fit is what matters more than anything else -- being able to match person's talents with individual roles.
    * Confront poor performance immediately and either find another role for employees or terminate them.
    * Individual excellence and specialization is what great teams build (focus on individual performance).
* Spend all time in your most productive team members.
    * Do not allocate your time to struggling members to help them improve; capitalize on making your productive team members as good as they can be, instead of trying to bring lower performers up to a baseline.
    * Evaluate employee performance every quarter and focus on individual strengths and how to leverage them (not on areas that can improve).
    * Managers need to know their employees and understand their strengths and personal lives.
* Define the right outcomes for your team and let them do their own thing in their own way.
    * Give your direct reports the ability to hit goals in their own way rather than dictating the specific steps they should take -- build autonomy.  This lets each employee play to their personal strengths instead of following a template.
* The Golden Rule is wrong
    * Treat others according to their individual needs (not as you'd treat you).

## The Q12 are twelve survey questions that direct reports would answer. Gallup's research indicates the answers are strongly correlated with real world outcomes.  

The first 6 are immediately actionable by managers. (1-5 scale):
* I know what's expected of me in job each day.  
* I have all necessary equipment and materials to do my job.
* I'm given opportunity to do my very best.  Are you being setup to succeed?
* My work has been recognized in past week.
* My supervisor truly cares about me as a human being.  
* I feel my opinion makes a difference.  

The next 6 are less actionable but nevertheless predictive of success:
* I believe in my company's mission and feel my job matters.  
* My coworkers are doing great work and care as much as I do.  
* I've developed good friends on job and feel comfortable.  
* Someone talks to me about my performance every quarter.  
* I feel I'm getting ample opportunities to grow and learn.
